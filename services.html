            <h3><u>Part Load (LTL)</u></h3>
            <p>In our LTL service, material is collected from the customer’s unit at their given time and then our company hub consolidates material with other cargo and moves it further. While clubbing the LTL material with other cargo, utmost care and attention is paid to the nature of goods so that the material  being transported  does not get damaged. The most important feature of our LTL service is that the material is made to arrive at final destination using only one transshipment which is at its point of origin. We load the material in same vehicle at the very first hub in which it will get door delivered to the client at the destination.  In cases, where material is over 5 ton, we pick up and deliver the LTL material in same vehicle, and add other material from our hub, resulting in zero transshipment for our customer.</p>
